            Kottayam is a city in the Indian state of Kerala. It is located in central Kerala and is also the administrative capital of Kottayam district. Bordered by the lofty and mighty Western Ghats on the east and the Vembanad Lake and paddy fields of Kuttanad on the west, Kottayam is a land of unique characteristics. Panoramic backwater stretches, lush paddy fields, highlands, hills and hillocks, extensive rubber plantations, places associated with many legends and a totally literate people have given Kottayam District the enviable title: The land of letters, legends, latex and lakes. The city is an important trading center of spices and commercial crops, especially rubber. Most of India’s natural rubber originates from the acres of well-kept plantations of Kottayam, also home to the Rubber Board. Kottayam is also called as “Akshara Nagari” which means the “city of letters” considering its contribution to print media and literature.

        <p class="tourist-para text-justify">
          Three hills, each rising to 4,000 ft and above, together form this huge hill. Each of these hills have a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom owing to which it gets its name Kuda Kallu (umbrella shaped rock). The medicinal herb Neela Koduveli, which bathes the hillsides in blue, grows here. This flower is also believed to possess supernatural powers which could increase wealth and ensure a rich harvest. The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu (hunchback rock). Across this rock is a 1/2 feet wide bridge called Narakapalam (bridge to hell). From the hilltops, the Arabian Sea can be seen in the distant horizon as a thin blue line. The sunset on a full moon day is sensational, when the moon can be seen rising up like another sun, as the orange sun goes down.

      <p class="tourist-para text-justify">
        Aruvikuzhi is a beautiful picnic spot and an ideal shooting location for movies. Aruvikuzhy Waterfalls, falling in five steps, is a real feast for the eyes. Here streams make their way through the landscape and the water roars as it cascades down the mountains from a height of 100 ft. It is an ideal place for trekking and is located in the midst of rubber plantations. The famous St. Mary’s Church is situated at the top of the waterfalls. The rubber plantation centre. Pallickathod, is just 1 km from this spot.      </p>

    <p class="tourist-para text-justify">
      Ilaveezha poonchira, a hill station near Melukavu Mattom, 60kms from Kottayam is gaining tourist importance.
      Located among three beautiful hillocks Mankunnu, Kudayathoormala and Thonippara, Poonchira is a place of picturesque charm. Legends say that the pool here was a bathing place for Panchali the legendary heroine of Mahabharata. The D.T.P.C. is developing this place into a trekking spot. A tourist bungalow with rooms and dormitory to accommodate 15 people has been constructed. The beautiful valleys of Poonchira are spread across thousands of acres. The verdant landscape punctuated by the gigantic hills, each rising to around 3200 ft. is an ideal place to unwind. During the monsoons when the valley fills up to form a scenic lake, this place unveils yet another beautiful slice of nature. Ilaveezha poonchira means valley where leaves don’t fall and is named so because the place has no trees. This is also one of the best places in Kerala to witness both the sun rise and sunset.      </p>
